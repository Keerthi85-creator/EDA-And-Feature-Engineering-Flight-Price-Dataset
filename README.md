# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction

## 📖 Overview
This project predicts airline ticket prices based on multiple factors such as airline, source, destination, number of stops, and journey details. The goal is to understand how different features influence flight prices and build a machine learning model for prediction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🔍 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and seasonality in flight data.  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).  
- Feature engineering: stop counts, duration/layover extraction, time-based features.  
- Model training using regression models (Linear, Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost).  
- Achieved **R² > 0.90** with CatBoost.  

## 📂 Dataset
- Airline flight dataset (public dataset from Kaggle).  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
